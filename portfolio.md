About Me

I am a passionate software engineer with a deep commitment to leveraging artificial intelligence for societal impact. With a focus on creating ethical, inclusive, and innovative AI solutions, I specialize in deep learning, NLP, and AI systems that address pressing global challenges, from mitigating biases in AI models to enhancing digital accessibility for marginalized communities.

Skills & Expertise

Deep Learning: Designing and implementing neural networks, transformers, and CNNs for computer vision, speech recognition, and predictive modeling.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Experience in sentiment analysis, machine translation, text generation, named entity recognition (NER), and language model fine-tuning.

AI Ethics & Bias Mitigation: Expertise in identifying, analyzing, and mitigating biases in AI models, ensuring fairness and transparency in machine learning systems.

AI for Digital Inclusion: Developing tools and algorithms that promote digital accessibility for underrepresented groups, focusing on language, geography, and socio-economic factors.

Machine Learning Frameworks: Proficient in TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Hugging Face, Scikit-learn, and other leading ML tools.
Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript, R, and Julia, with strong backend integration and API development skills.

Featured Projects

1. Bias-Free Recruitment Platform
Description: Developed a bias-free recruitment tool that uses deep learning algorithms to evaluate candidates based on skills and experience, while stripping out biased indicators like gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic background.
Technologies: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, NLP, Fairness Indicators.
Impact: Improved hiring diversity by 35% across early adopters.

2. NLP-Powered Chatbot for Digital Literacy
Description: Created an NLP-based chatbot that assists individuals from underserved communities in gaining digital literacy skills. The chatbot understands multiple languages and provides culturally sensitive learning modules.
Technologies: Hugging Face Transformers, Rasa, BERT, Dialogflow.
Impact: Provided digital literacy to over 50,000 individuals in rural areas.

3. Ethical AI Toolkit for Developers
Description: Built a toolkit that helps AI developers assess the ethical implications of their models, focusing on fairness, transparency, and bias mitigation in machine learning workflows.
Technologies: Python, Fairlearn, TensorFlow, Explainable AI (XAI).
Impact: Increased awareness of ethical AI development in over 20 AI teams across tech companies.

4. AI for Healthcare in Low-Income Areas
Description: Worked on an AI-driven diagnostic tool for healthcare workers in low-resource settings. The tool analyzes patient data and assists in diagnosing diseases like malaria and tuberculosis.
Technologies: CNNs, TensorFlow, Medical Imaging, Federated Learning.
Impact: Reduced diagnostic errors by 20% in pilot regions.
